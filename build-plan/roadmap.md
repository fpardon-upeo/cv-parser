# CV Parser Project Roadmap

## Project Timeline Overview

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Week 1) âœ…
- [x] Initialize project structure
- [x] Set up virtual environment
- [x] Create requirements.txt
- [x] Configure basic settings
- [x] Set up logging
- [x] Configure pre-commit hooks
- [x] Set up initial documentation

### Phase 2: Core Document Parsing (Week 2) âœ…
- [x] Design parser interface
- [x] PDF parsing implementation
- [x] DOCX parsing implementation
- [x] TXT parsing implementation
- [x] Unified parsing interface
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Unit tests for parsing

### Phase 3: Model Development (Week 3) ðŸš€
- [ ] Data collection and preparation
- [ ] Parser model implementation with smolmodels
- [ ] Anonymizer model implementation with smolmodels
- [ ] Model testing and optimization
- [ ] Model versioning system
- [ ] Integration tests
- [x] API endpoints implementation
- [x] Mock implementation for development

### Phase 4: API Development (Week 4)
- [x] FastAPI application setup
- [ ] Authentication implementation
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [x] /parse endpoint
- [x] /anonymize endpoint
- [x] /visualization endpoint
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] End-to-end testing

## Current Status
- Phase 1 (Project Setup): âœ… Completed
- Phase 2 (Document Parsing): âœ… Completed
- Phase 3 (Model Development): ðŸš€ In Progress (API endpoints implemented, but small language models not yet implemented)
- Phase 4 (API Development): ðŸš€ Partially Implemented

## Success Metrics
- 90% parsing accuracy
- < 5s response time for parsing
- < 10s response time for anonymization
- 100% test coverage
- Zero security vulnerabilities

## Future Enhancements
- Support for additional file formats
- Advanced anonymization options
- Batch processing capabilities
- Model fine-tuning interface
- Performance optimization
- User interface for testing
