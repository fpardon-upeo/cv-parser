## Challenges and Blockers

### Challenge: smolmodels Integration
**Problem**: The current implementation uses mock data instead of actual small language models.
**Solution**: Need to install and configure the smolmodels library, create proper datasets, and train the models.

### Challenge: Training Data Preparation
**Problem**: Labeled datasets for training the models have not been created yet.
**Solution**: Need to process the sample documents and create structured input-output pairs for model training.

### Challenge: Model Training Resources
**Problem**: Training small language models requires computational resources and time.
**Solution**: Need to allocate appropriate resources and time for model training.

## Next Steps

1. Install and configure the smolmodels library
2. Prepare labeled datasets for model training
3. Define and train the parser model
4. Define and train the anonymizer model
5. Replace mock implementation with actual models
6. Test and optimize model performance

## Revised Timeline

- Complete data preparation: April 11, 2024
- Complete model training: April 13, 2024
- Complete model integration: April 15, 2024
- Complete testing and optimization: April 17, 2024

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 is currently focused on document parsing and API implementation, but the core goal of implementing small language models using smolmodels has not yet been addressed. The mock implementation provides a foundation for the API, but significant work remains to implement the actual models as specified in the requirements.
