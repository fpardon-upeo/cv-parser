- Test end-to-end functionality

## Daily Tasks Breakdown

### Day 1: smolmodels Setup

- Configure any required credentials
- Create simple test script to verify functionality

### Day 2: smolmodels Testing
- Create simple proof-of-concept models
- Test model building and inference
- Document smolmodels usage patterns
- Identify any potential issues or limitations

### Day 3: Data Organization
- Organize sample CV/resume documents
- Categorize documents by format and complexity
- Create metadata for each sample document
- Document data sources and collection methods

### Day 4: Dataset Creation
- Process documents using existing parsers
- Create labeled examples for parser model
- Create labeled examples for anonymizer model
- Split data into training and validation sets

### Day 5: Parser Model Definition
- Define parser model intent as specified in requirements
- Implement input schema for resume text and file type
- Implement output schema for structured candidate data
- Validate schema against requirements

### Day 6: Parser Model Training
- Prepare training configuration
- Implement model building using prepared datasets
- Execute training process
- Evaluate model performance
- Implement model saving and loading

### Day 7: Anonymizer Model Definition
- Define anonymizer model intent as specified in requirements
- Implement input schema for parsed resume and anonymization level
- Implement output schema for anonymized resume
- Validate schema against requirements

### Day 8: Anonymizer Model Training
- Prepare training configuration
- Implement model building using prepared datasets
- Execute training process
- Implement configurable anonymization levels
- Evaluate model performance
- Implement model saving and loading

### Day 9: API Integration (Parser)
- Replace mock parser implementation with actual model
- Update parser API endpoints to use trained model
- Implement caching for parser model results
- Add performance monitoring for parser operations

### Day 10: API Integration (Anonymizer)
- Replace mock anonymizer implementation with actual model
- Update anonymizer API endpoints to use trained model
- Implement caching for anonymizer model results
- Add performance monitoring for anonymizer operations
- Test end-to-end functionality

## Success Criteria
- Parser model successfully extracts structured information from CV/resume documents
- Anonymizer model successfully anonymizes personal information at different levels
- API endpoints correctly use the trained models
- Models process documents in <5 seconds on average
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Risk Mitigation
- If smolmodels installation or configuration issues arise, allocate additional time for troubleshooting
- If model training takes longer than expected, focus on one model at a time
- If performance is below expectations, implement caching and optimization techniques
- Keep the mock implementation as a fallback in case of issues with the actual models
