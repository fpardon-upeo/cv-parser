# Sprint 3: Model Development

## Sprint Goal
Implement intelligent models for parsing and anonymizing CV/resume documents using the smolmodels library, with a focus on accuracy, performance, and privacy.

## Timeline
- Start Date: April 4, 2024
- End Date: April 10, 2024
- Duration: 5 working days

## Agile Approach
This sprint follows an agile methodology with the following principles:
- Each user story results in a demonstrable outcome that can be shown or tested
- Regular reviews of completed work to gather feedback
- Iterative improvements based on feedback
- Continuous integration of completed components

## User Stories

### US1: Data Collection and Preparation
**As a data scientist, I need to collect and prepare a diverse dataset of CVs/resumes for training the parser and anonymizer models.**

**Technical Design:**
- Collect sample CV/resume documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Process documents using existing parsers from Sprint 2
- Create labeled datasets for model training
- Implement data validation and quality checks
- Ensure data privacy and compliance

**Ties to Overall Solution:**
This user story provides the foundation for training the smolmodels. High-quality, diverse data is essential for developing models that can handle real-world CV/resume documents with varying formats, structures, and content.

**Demonstrable Outcome:**
- A structured dataset of processed CV/resume documents ready for model training
- Data quality report showing completeness and correctness metrics
- Sample input-output pairs that will be used for training

### US2: Parser Model Implementation with smolmodels
**As a developer, I need to implement a model that can extract structured information from parsed documents using smolmodels.**

**Technical Design:**
- Define parser model intent and schema as specified in requirements
- Set up smolmodels environment and dependencies
- Implement parser model using smolmodels API
- Train the model using prepared datasets
- Save and version the trained model

**Ties to Overall Solution:**
This user story implements the intelligent parsing functionality using smolmodels. The parser model will transform raw text into structured data that can be used for analysis, search, and other applications.

**Demonstrable Outcome:**
- A working parser model that can extract structured information from CV/resume documents
- Demo script showing model inference on sample documents
- Performance metrics showing accuracy and processing time

### US3: Anonymizer Model Implementation with smolmodels
**As a developer, I need to implement a model that can identify and anonymize personal information in documents using smolmodels.**

**Technical Design:**
- Define anonymizer model intent and schema as specified in requirements
- Implement anonymizer model using smolmodels API
- Train the model using prepared datasets
- Implement configurable anonymization levels
- Save and version the trained model

**Ties to Overall Solution:**
This user story ensures privacy and compliance by anonymizing sensitive information in CV/resume documents. This is critical for data protection regulations and ethical data handling.

**Demonstrable Outcome:**
- A working anonymizer model that can identify and anonymize PII in CV/resume documents
- Demo script showing anonymization at different levels (basic, moderate, thorough)
- Before/after examples showing anonymized content

### US4: Model Testing and Optimization
**As a quality engineer, I need to test and optimize the models for accuracy, performance, and robustness.**

**Technical Design:**
- Create test suite for model evaluation
- Implement performance benchmarks
- Test models with various document formats and structures
- Optimize model parameters for better performance
- Document model performance characteristics

**Ties to Overall Solution:**
This user story ensures the models meet quality standards and perform efficiently in production environments. Thorough testing and optimization are essential for reliable model performance.

**Demonstrable Outcome:**
- Comprehensive test results showing model performance across different scenarios
- Performance benchmark report comparing before/after optimization
- Documentation of optimization techniques and their impact

### US5: Model Versioning and Management
**As a DevOps engineer, I need to implement a system for tracking and managing model versions.**

**Technical Design:**
- Set up model storage and versioning
- Implement model metadata tracking
- Create model deployment workflow
- Implement model rollback capabilities
- Document model versioning process

**Ties to Overall Solution:**
This user story enables model updates and ensures backward compatibility. A robust versioning system is essential for managing model lifecycle and maintaining service reliability.

**Demonstrable Outcome:**
- Working model versioning system with multiple model versions stored
- Demo of model deployment and rollback procedures
- Documentation of the versioning system and workflows

### US6: Integration with API
**As a developer, I need to integrate the models with the API endpoints for parsing and anonymizing documents.**

**Technical Design:**
- Create model loading and initialization in API
- Implement model inference in API endpoints
- Add error handling for model failures
- Implement caching for performance optimization
- Create comprehensive logging for model usage

**Ties to Overall Solution:**
This user story connects the models to the API endpoints, enabling the service to parse and anonymize documents through a REST interface. This integration is critical for the overall functionality of the service.

**Demonstrable Outcome:**
- Working API endpoints that use the trained models for parsing and anonymization
- API documentation with example requests and responses
- Performance metrics for API endpoints

## Dependencies
- smolmodels library
- Sample CV/resume documents for training (available in app/data/)
- Existing document parsers from Sprint 2
- FastAPI for API integration
- pytest for testing

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Insufficient training data | Use synthetic data generation through smolmodels |
| Model accuracy below target | Adjust model intent and parameters, provide more examples |
| Performance bottlenecks | Profile and optimize critical paths, implement caching |
| Privacy concerns with training data | Implement strict anonymization protocols for all training data |
| Integration issues with API | Comprehensive integration testing and clear interface definitions |
| smolmodels limitations | Implement fallback mechanisms for edge cases |

## Success Criteria
- Parser model achieves >85% accuracy on test dataset
- Anonymizer model identifies >95% of PII
- Models process documents in <5 seconds on average
- All models have versioning and can be rolled back if needed
- Integration tests pass with >90% coverage
- Documentation is complete and up-to-date
- Each user story results in a demonstrable outcome that can be shown or tested
